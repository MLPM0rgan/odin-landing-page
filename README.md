Dear Reader, 
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat. Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Or, in English, this is the first major development project while learning this programming stuff. My goal is to use this site as a recipe book for my partner and I, and have it act as a living document through our lives together (it’s not that dramatic, I just couldn’t think of different phrasing).

I aim to build in some functionality like a randomizer to choose our weeknight dinners for us, build a shopping list, and other functions I think of along the way.
The landing page format was a project as a part of The Odin Project, which I am following to learn web development as a means of dipping my feet into programming. Big fan of the Odin Project; it has been great so far for me. I will update this repo and README as I go along, working on it in my free time to practice HTML & CSS. Its current state is just the landing page, with a few placeholders for future content.

Sincerely,
MLPM0rgan
